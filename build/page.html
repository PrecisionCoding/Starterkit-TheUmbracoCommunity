                            By now you’ve either heard of the horrible incident at the Cincinnati Zoo that ended with the killing of a 17-year-old western lowland silverback gorilla named Harambe in order to protect the 3-year-old child who tumbled into his habitat OR you had a great Memorial Day weekend away from the Internet. Either/or.

                            This is the perfect (shit) storm for the Internet, especially the American variety, because it involves: a) kids, b) animals, and c) parenting. All of the things that the Internet likes to flip its collective wig over. All of the things that allow the Monday morning quarterbacking to gush forth in a rage orgy. Someone needs to pay! She’s a woman? Let’s call her horrible names! This is our chance, Internet!

                            I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but in the aftermath of all kinds of tragedies in this country, one of the most common questions that’s asked—after “Oh my God is everyone alright?” or “How many people were killed?”—is “Where was the mother?” (always the mother) or “What kind of horrible monster raised this kid-teenager-grown ass adult?”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was asked after Columbine. It’s asked after other mass shootings because as we all know, mothers alone create mass murderers. And it’s asked any time a child is injured or killed, because we as mothers should at all times be following our children with one of those life net things that firefighters use. But we must also do this invisibly because otherwise: HELICOPTER. Because when bad things happen, someone is always, always, always to blame. And that person is usually a mother. Everyone in this country and on the Internet knows that.

                            Have you ever seen a silverback gorilla? I have. I took my kids to the National Zoo in Washington D.C. over February vacation. Lots of families! So many kids and parents! So what I’m saying is the zoo was a shit show, like all zoos are! It was the first time we all got a glimpse at a male silverback gorilla. I kept saying things like, “Ack!” and “Holy smokes!” But my internal-in-my-head reaction was, “Jesus Christ, if this guy got out I’d evacuate the entirety of my bowels into my pants and purse and fucking pray to die first.”
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So it’s cool that everyone wants to <strong>second</strong> guess the zoo’s decision from the comfort of their laptops while they leisurely sip a Frappuccino in front of a fan. But I think the expectation that everyone at the zoo would just chill while a 3-year-old boy is inside a gorilla habitat just to see how it all “plays out” is absurd.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But unlike the Internet, I’m not here to pretend I’m <a href="">some sort of expert</a> on gorilla behavior after one zoo visit. What I am here to do is wonder aloud, to you the people of Medium and America and the Internet, do you believe that accidents happen anymore? Or is everything that goes wrong always someone’s fault? Is there always someone to sue? Is there always someone to point a finger at? Because that must mean that everyone is imperfect and negligent and possibly a criminal. Everyone, that is of course, except for you.

                            I get it—if someone’s always to blame then there will always be a reason horrible things happen. But that’s just not how things work. Sometimes everything goes wrong, all at the same time.

                            Six years ago a five-year-old girl in the same town where we now live was killed while riding her bicycle. It happened on one of the first beautiful May days that felt like summer might just come back to Vermont. She was out riding her bike with her parents walking behind, a car approached and was about to turn when he noticed she was having a problem with her bike. He waited. The parents thanked him and waved him on, no one realizing that she had suddenly sped up on her bike, and the driver—not seeing her—turned, pinning her underneath. Neighbors came running out with car jacks, anything, everything they could do to help free her, but it was too late. Nothing helped. They couldn’t save her.
