# Starterkit - The Umbraco Community

TODO: This code needs to be moved into the https://github.com/umbraco/7.6-Starter-Kit project and then we can remove this repo.
the other repo is already ahead of this one so there will be some manual merging

### Getting started
To get started simply clone this repository into your dev environment, and run `npm install` to download the dependencies, then run `bower install` to require dependencies used in the project. Once completed you can run `gulp` to start it up.

The workflow creates a `/build` directory with all the compiled files.
You can change this paths in the `gulpfile.js` file.

### Where do I put things?
The `/src` directory is where your development files goes. A folder structure is included in the repo. It's fairly simple to get started with.

### Boilerplate
The workflow comes with a bit of boilerplate, which we use in almost any new project.

### SCSS
In the `src/scss` directory we've put an `style.scss` file which functions as our main stylesheet file.

### JS
In the `src/js` folder we've put a `app.js` file which just hold a simple self invoking function.
